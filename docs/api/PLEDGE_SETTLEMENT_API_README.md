# Pledge Settlement API Documentation

## Overview

The Pledge Settlement API provides comprehensive calculation of settlement details for pledges, including detailed interest calculations based on complex business rules. This endpoint calculates the exact amount needed to settle a pledge, including accrued interest, payments made, and remaining balances.

## Features

- ✅ **Complex Interest Calculation**: Implements sophisticated interest calculation rules
- ✅ **Mandatory First Month Interest**: Always charges full first month interest
- ✅ **Partial Month Handling**: Smart calculation for pledges within same calendar month
- ✅ **Payment Tracking**: Integrates with payment history to calculate remaining balances
- ✅ **Detailed Breakdown**: Provides period-by-period interest calculation details
- ✅ **Real-time Calculation**: Calculates settlement amount as of current date
- ✅ **Business Rule Compliance**: Follows pawn shop industry standard practices

## Interest Calculation Rules

### 1. Mandatory First Month Interest
- **Rule**: First month interest is always charged (full month)
- **Purpose**: Standard pawn shop practice for immediate interest collection
- **Amount**: Uses the `first_month_interest` field from pledge record
- **Non-negotiable**: This amount is always included regardless of actual days

### 2. Same Calendar Month Rules
When a pledge is created and settlement is calculated within the same calendar month:

#### If ≤ 15 Days
```
Additional Interest = (Principal × Monthly Rate ÷ 100) × 0.5
Total Interest = Mandatory First Month + Half Month Additional
```

#### If > 15 Days
```
Additional Interest = (Principal × Monthly Rate ÷ 100) × 1.0
Total Interest = Mandatory First Month + Full Month Additional
```

### 3. Subsequent Months
From the second month onwards, interest accrues normally:
- **Complete Months**: Full monthly interest charged
- **Partial Months**: Proportional interest based on actual days
- **Formula**: `(Principal × Monthly Rate ÷ 100) × (Days in Period ÷ Days in Month)`

## Business Logic Examples

### Example 1: Pledge Created January 15, Settlement February 20

```
Pledge Date: 2024-01-15
Settlement Date: 2024-02-20
Principal: $50,000
Monthly Rate: 3%
Mandatory First Month: $2,500

Calculation:
1. Month 1 (Mandatory): $2,500 (always charged)
2. Month 2 (Partial): 20 days of February
   Interest = $50,000 × 3% × (20/29) = $1,034.48

Total Interest = $2,500 + $1,034.48 = $3,534.48
```

### Example 2: Pledge Within Same Month (≤ 15 days)

```
Pledge Date: 2024-01-15
Settlement Date: 2024-01-25 (10 days)
Principal: $50,000
Monthly Rate: 3%
Mandatory First Month: $2,500

Calculation:
1. Month 1 (Mandatory): $2,500
2. Additional (Half Month): $50,000 × 3% × 0.5 = $750

Total Interest = $2,500 + $750 = $3,250
```

### Example 3: Pledge Within Same Month (> 15 days)

```
Pledge Date: 2024-01-15
Settlement Date: 2024-01-25 (20 days)
Principal: $50,000
Monthly Rate: 3%
Mandatory First Month: $2,500

Calculation:
1. Month 1 (Mandatory): $2,500
2. Additional (Full Month): $50,000 × 3% × 1.0 = $1,500

Total Interest = $2,500 + $1,500 = $4,000
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

#### 404 - Pledge Not Found
```json
{
    "detail": "Pledge not found"
}
```

#### 401 - Unauthorized
```json
{
    "detail": "Not authenticated"
}
```

#### 403 - Forbidden
```json
{
    "detail": "Not enough permissions"
}
```

## Integration with Payment System

The settlement API automatically integrates with the payment system to provide accurate remaining balances:

1. **Retrieves Payment History**: Gets all payments made against the pledge
2. **Separates Payment Types**: Distinguishes between interest and principal payments
3. **Calculates Remaining Amounts**: Subtracts payments from accrued amounts
4. **Provides Final Settlement**: Shows exact amount needed to close the pledge

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Settlement Check

```python
import requests

headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"}
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/pledges/123/settlement",
    headers=headers
)

settlement = response.json()
print(f"Final settlement amount: ${settlement['final_amount']:,.2f}")
```

### Example 2: Detailed Interest Analysis

```python
settlement = response.json()

print("Interest Calculation Breakdown:")
for detail in settlement["interest_calculation_details"]:
    status = "MANDATORY" if detail["is_mandatory"] else "CALCULATED"
    print(f"  {detail['period']}: ${detail['interest_amount']:,.2f} [{status}]")
    print(f"    Period: {detail['from_date']} to {detail['to_date']}")
    print(f"    Days: {detail['days']}, Rate: {detail['rate_percent']}%")
```

### Example 3: Settlement vs Payment Comparison

```python
settlement = response.json()

print(f"Total Interest Due: ${settlement['total_interest']:,.2f}")
print(f"Interest Paid: ${settlement['paid_interest']:,.2f}")
print(f"Outstanding Interest: ${settlement['remaining_interest']:,.2f}")

print(f"Principal Amount: ${settlement['loan_amount']:,.2f}")
print(f"Principal Paid: ${settlement['paid_principal']:,.2f}")
print(f"Outstanding Principal: ${settlement['remaining_principal']:,.2f}")

print(f"Final Settlement Required: ${settlement['final_amount']:,.2f}")
```
