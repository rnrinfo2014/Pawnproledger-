# PAWN SHOP SETTLEMENT CALCULATION - CORRECTED BUSINESS LOGIC

## Overview
The pledge settlement calculation API has been updated to correctly implement pawn shop business rules. This ensures accurate financial calculations and prevents double-charging of interest.

## ✅ CORRECTED Business Rules Implementation

### Rule 1: First Month Interest Collection
- **When**: At pledge creation time
- **Amount**: Pre-calculated `first_month_interest` (e.g., ₹1,800 for ₹90,000 loan at 2% monthly)
- **Status**: Already paid/collected upfront
- **Logic**: This is mandatory and non-refundable

### Rule 2: Same Month Settlement (< 1 month difference)
- **Condition**: Settlement date is within the same month as pledge date
- **Formula**: `Settlement Amount = Loan Amount Only`
- **Reasoning**: First month interest was already collected, no additional interest
- **Example**: 
  - Pledge: Sep 15, 2025
  - Settlement: Sep 16, 2025 (1 day later)
  - Result: Settlement = ₹90,000 (no additional interest)

### Rule 3: Multiple Months Settlement
- **Condition**: Settlement after completing 1 or more full months
- **Formula**: `Settlement Amount = Loan Amount + (Completed Months × Monthly Interest)`
- **Examples**:
  - **1 Month**: Pledge Sep 15 → Settlement Oct 16 = ₹90,000 + ₹1,800 = ₹91,800
  - **2 Months**: Pledge Sep 15 → Settlement Nov 16 = ₹90,000 + ₹3,600 = ₹93,600
  - **3 Months**: Pledge Sep 15 → Settlement Dec 16 = ₹90,000 + ₹5,400 = ₹95,400

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint
```
GET /api/pledges/{pledge_id}/settlement
```

### Month Calculation Logic
```python
# Calculate months difference
months_diff = (calculation_date.year - pledge_date.year) * 12 + (calculation_date.month - pledge_date.month)

# Adjust for day difference
if calculation_date.day < pledge_date.day:
    months_diff -= 1

# Apply business rules
if months_diff <= 0:
    pending_interest = 0.0  # Same month - no additional interest
else:
    pending_interest = months_diff * (loan_amount * monthly_interest_rate / 100)
```

## 📊 Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Same Month Settlement
- **Pledge Date**: September 15, 2025
- **Settlement Date**: September 16, 2025
- **Loan Amount**: ₹90,000
- **Monthly Rate**: 2%
- **Months Difference**: 0 (same month)

**Calculation**:
- First month interest (already paid): ₹1,800
- Additional interest: ₹0 (same month)
- **Settlement Amount**: ₹90,000

### Example 2: One Month Completed
- **Pledge Date**: September 15, 2025
- **Settlement Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Months Difference**: 1

**Calculation**:
- First month interest (already paid): ₹1,800
- Additional interest: 1 × ₹1,800 = ₹1,800
- **Settlement Amount**: ₹90,000 + ₹1,800 = ₹91,800

### Example 3: Two Months Completed
- **Pledge Date**: September 15, 2025
- **Settlement Date**: November 16, 2025
- **Months Difference**: 2

**Calculation**:
- First month interest (already paid): ₹1,800
- Additional interest: 2 × ₹1,800 = ₹3,600
- **Settlement Amount**: ₹90,000 + ₹3,600 = ₹93,600
